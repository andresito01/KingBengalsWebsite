      <p className={BreedInfoCSS.text}>
        The Bengal breed of cats gets their name from the Asian leopard cat,
        taxonomic name: <i>Prionailurus bengalensis</i>, from which they are
        bred together with domestic cat breeds and usually again with cat breeds
        that have a more friendly nature. Bengal cats are considered domestic
        when they are at least the fourth generation away from their wild
        grandparent. The Bengal breed was officially recognized by The
        International Cat Association --TICA-- in 1986, and was granted
        championship status in 1991.
        <br />
        <br />
        With their appearance of a miniature leopard, the initial goal was to
        produce a cat breed to serve as an alternative to keeping wild cats as
        pets. Bengals are strikingly known for being the only domestic cat breed
        to feature "rosettes" --spotted markings-- though their fur can sport an
        assortment of stripes and swirls.
        <br />
        <br />
        The earliest mentions of a Asian leopard cat and domestic breed cross
        appeared in the first cat pedigree book{" "}
        <i>Our Cats and All About Them</i>, written by Harrison Weir in 1889.
        However, cat breeder and conservationalist Jean Mill is credited with
        creating the modern Bengal cat breed. Mill created the her first Asian
        leopard cat and black tomcat cross in 1963, making this F1 cross the
        first documented mating of an Asian leopard cat with a domestic breed.
        She would become venture in earnest with her breeding program in 1970,
        when she received a gift of Bengal cats by Willard Centerwall.
        <br />
        <br />
        In 1982, during her travels in India, Mill obtained two Egyptian Mau
        cats and bred them with the Centerwall Bengal cats. Mill would succeed
        where other Bengal breeders failed: she would retain the fertility of
        Bengal crossbreeds from the F1 through F4 generations and achieved a
        fertile F5 Bengal with a domestic cat temperament.

        The Bengal is a medium-to-high maintenance cat, as they have are very
        active, energetic, and very affectionate with their owner. Though not
        typically lap cats, Bengals very much enjoy the company on their Breed,
        and do best with another cat buddy to keep them company.
        <br />
        <br />
        Bengals remain athletic even into their senior years, and require a
        decent amount of space and forms of entertainment to keep content;
        plenty of second-story territory in the form of catwalks, perches, and
        cat trees are great ways to satisfy a Bengal's explorative spirit.
        Unlike most cat breeds, Bengals like the water, and could opt to join
        their owner in the shower to play in the running water!
        <br />
        <br />
        In terms of grooming and nutrition, the Bengal does not demand any
        particular care. Routine coat brushing and monthly claw trimming, and
        ideally teeth- brushing, will be enough for most Bengals.
